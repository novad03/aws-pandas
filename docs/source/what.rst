What is AWS Data Wrangler?

An `open-source <https://github.com/awslabs/aws-data-wrangler>`_ Python package that extends the power of `Pandas <https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas>`_ library to AWS connecting **DataFrames** and AWS data related services (**Amazon Redshift**, **AWS Glue**, **Amazon Athena**, **Amazon EMR**, etc).
