Installation
============

    >>> pip install awswrangler

Runs only with Python 3.6 and beyond.

Runs anywhere (AWS Lambda, AWS Glue Python Shell, EMR, EC2, on-premises, local, etc).

**P.S.** Lambda Layer's bundle and Glue's wheel/egg are available to `download <https://github.com/awslabs/aws-data-wrangler/releases>`_. Just upload it and run! ðŸš€

**P.P.S.** Have you never used Layers? Check the :ref:`step-by-step guide <Setting Up Lambda Layer>`.

**P.P.P.S.** AWS Data Wrangler counts with compiled dependencies (C/C++) so there is no support for Glue PySpark by now.
