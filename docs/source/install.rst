Install
============

    >>> pip install awswrangler

    >>> conda install -c conda-forge awswrangler

Runs with Python 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8.

Runs anywhere (AWS Lambda, AWS Glue Python Shell, EMR, EC2, on-premises, local, etc).

.. note:: Lambda Layer's bundle and Glue's wheel/egg are available to `download <https://github.com/awslabs/aws-data-wrangler/releases>`_. Just upload it and run! ðŸš€
.. note:: Have you never used Layers? Check the :ref:`step-by-step guide <Setting Up Lambda Layer>`.
.. note:: AWS Data Wrangler counts with compiled dependencies (C/C++) so there is no support for Glue PySpark by now.
.. note:: PySpark doesn't support Python 3.8 yet.
