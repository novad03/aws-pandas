.. warning:: Version 1.0.0 coming soon with several breaking changes. Please, pin the version you are using on your environment.

             AWS Data Wrangler is completing 1 year, and the team is working to collect feedbacks and features requests to put in our 1.0.0 version. By now we have 3 major changes listed:

             - API redesign
             - Nested data types support
             - Deprecation of PySpark support
                 - PySpark support takes considerable part of the development time and it has not been reflected in user adoption. Only 2 of our 66 issues on GitHub are related to Spark.
                 - In addition, the integration between PySpark and PyArrow/Pandas remains in experimental stage and we have been experiencing tough times to keep it stable.
